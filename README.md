# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan
## Overview

### Brief Introduction

AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles course does not have a designated programming language. Teachers have the flexibility to choose a programming language(s) that is most appropriate for their students to use in the classroom.

Computer science involves problem-solving, hardware, and algorithms that help people utilize computers and incorporate multiple perspectives to address real-world problems in contemporary life. As the application of computer science is integrated into more aspects of our lives, it is important to understand the impact of computer science and how to maintain privacy, safety, and security not only when using computers but also while being the innovators of new computing applications. The course strives to engage all students, including those who have traditionally been underrepresented in computer science—such as female students, students of color, students with disabilities, and rural students—by allowing them to discover the power of computer science through rewarding yet challenging concepts.
A well-designed AP Computer Science Principles course that includes opportunities for students to collaborate to solve problems of their choice can help address traditional issues of equity and access. Such a course can broaden participation in computing while providing a strong and engaging introduction to the breadth of topics in the discipline.
The AP Computer Science Principles course reflects what computer science teachers, professors, and researchers have indicated are the main goals of an introductory, college-level computer science course:
<li>Computational Solution Design—Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose. </li>
<li>Algorithms and Program Development—Develop and implement algorithms.</li>
<li>Abstraction in Program Development—Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.</li>
<li>Code Analysis—Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.</li>
<li>Computing Innovations—Investigate computing innovations.</li>
<li>Responsible Computing—Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.</li>

Students practice their computer science skills when designing and developing programs that address real-world problems and when investigating computing innovations they use or are interested in better understanding.</li>


### Prerequisites

<u>Content Knowledge</u>
It is recommended that students in the AP Computer Science Principles course have successfully completed a first-year high school algebra course with a strong foundation of basic linear functions, composition of functions, and problem-solving strategies that require multiple approaches and collaborative efforts. In addition, students should be able to use a Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system to represent points on a plane. It is important that students and their advisers understand that any significant computer science course builds upon a foundation of mathematical reasoning that should be acquired before attempting such a course. Prior computer science experience is not required to take this course. (Special cases may be considered) 

#### Resource Requirements

Students should have access to a computer system(s) that contains appropriate software to create and edit programs and allows students to practice, complete, and submit the AP Computer Science Principles performance task. The computer must have Internet access and be able to access the sites necessary for students to be successful in the course and
assessment. The school ensures that each student has access to the AP Computer Science Principles Exam Reference Sheet (see Appendix), as well as performance task directions and scoring guidelines. The school ensures that each student has a college-level text or curricular resources deemed necessary by the teacher for individual use inside and outside of
the classroom.

## Context

### Course

AP Computer Science Principles

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

Computer Science Principles - AP
Computer Science Principles - CP

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software installed as well as any online services.
####Operating System

ChromeOS

####Online IDE

AP - CodeHS
AP - Replit
CP - Scratch

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements wherever necessary.

Pleasant Valley High School (PVHS) is a one-to-one technology high school. Each student has a Chromebook. Since all work for this class will be completed and submitted using an Online IDE no other hardware will be required.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* do students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
