### Introduction

#### <ins>Rationale</ins>

Computer science education can and should be available to all students. With a world that is continuing toward a reliance on computers and other computer related peripherals, computer science education is quickly cementing itself as a core part of a student's foundational learning. Prioritizing computer science in the K12 curriculum helps students to develop critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and logical reasoning skills that they can later apply in their lives in meaningful and relevant ways. In addition to non-academic applications, computer science has relevance toward a student’s aspiration toward higher education. When implemented correctly, computer science can potentially count as a third year of science credit, fourth year of math credit, a general elective credit, career technical education credit, and or a dual enrollment course (master’s degree dependent). Computer science is highly versatile, being able to satisfy many high school graduation requirements and many university eligibility requirements, incentivizing a diverse population of students to enroll.  Data suggests that early exposure to computer science has long term-term effects on the future college and career choices students make. Clearly, the versatility and long-term influence computer science has on current and future students' overall success advocates for the importance of adopting computer science curriculum and standards as soon as possible.

#### <ins>Description</ins>
  
AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) is one of the newest AP courses from the College Board.  AP CSP introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and explores the impact computing and technology have on our society. There are no official prerequisites (C or better is IM1/Algebra 1 recommended) and the course is meant to be a first-time introduction to computer science, but students should be comfortable with functions and function notation. AP CSP is a year-long high school curriculum that fully addresses the five “Big Ideas” of computer science and six “Computational Thinking Practices,” as specified by the College Board’s [AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course). In addition, the CodeHS platform (and related courses) are well aligned with [California Computer Science Standards and Standards Framework](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eQhWPbfu_720GkExFV0U89dYs8eNCUV/view?usp=share_link), [Common Core Math Standards](https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/ccssmathstandardaug2013.pdf), and [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ca/sc/ngssstandards.asp) most notably.

The lessons and materials used throughout this curriculum incorporate Project-Based Learning (PBL), a pedagogical approach that actively engages students in the educational process, improves retention, and develops problem-solving, critical-thinking, and group communication skills. Through this collaborative, learner-centric approach, students are encouraged to explore the advantages and societal impact of computational technology while developing their own programming and computational thinking skills.

#### <ins>Overarching Goals</ins>

Beyond the ample rationale for the importance of incorporating computer science in schools, there are primary, overarching goals for the course as a whole. With a surging dependency on computers AP CSP aims to:

<ul>  
<li>Increase and diversify Chico Unified’s participation in computer science.</li>
<li>Develop, regardless of prior experience in computing, students confidence using computer science as a tool to express themselves and solve problems, and this confidence will prepare them for success in future endeavors in the field of computer science.</li>
<li>Help students understand the core principles of computing, a field which has and continues to change the world.</li>
<li>Guide students in the development of computational artifacts to solve problems, communicate ideas, and express their own creativity.</li>
<li>Foster collaboration with others (faculty, staff, and students) to solve problems and develop computational artifacts Students will be able to explain the impact computing has on society, economy, and culture.</li>
<li>Assist students as they analyze existing artifacts, identify and correct errors, and explain how the artifact functions.</li>
<li>Help students explore and explain how data, information, or knowledge is represented for computational use.</li>
<li>Help students explain how abstractions are used in computation and modeling.</li>
<li>Educate students on how to be informed and responsible users of technology.</li>
</ul>

#### <ins>Learning Environment</ins>

The course utilizes a blended classroom approach. The content is a mix of web-based and physical activities. Students will write and run code in the browser, create websites and digital artifacts, and engage in in-person collaborative exercises with classmates. Teachers utilize tools and resources provided by CodeHS to leverage time in the classroom, complexity of assigned tasks and give focused 1-on-1 attention to students. Each unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist of video tutorials, short quizzes, example programs to explore, written programming exercises, free response exercises, collaborative creation projects, and research projects.

AP CSP curriculum from CodeHS allows for educators to implement both Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Culturally Responsive Education (CRE) pedagogical techniques in order to better engage students in the learning process. By encouraging students to use critical thinking skills and challenging them to solve authentic and meaningful problems, PBL helps students to develop a deeper and more profound understanding of the power of computation in our everyday lives. In teaching this curriculum, educators are encouraged to utilize the range of PBL and CRE techniques that have been incorporated into each unit, including driving questions, overarching unit projects, clear rubrics, regular benchmarks, scaffolding activities, final products, and reflection. Used together in a coherent, unified manner that actively engages students in the educational process, PBL and CRE strategies can help students improve their retention of learned experiences and develop stronger problem solving, critical thinking, and group communication skills.

#### <ins>Programming Environment</ins>

Students write and run programs in the browser using the CodeHS integrated development environment (IDE). Students will be able to write text-based Python programs, and students will use a graphics library to create Python graphical programs. Students gain programming experience early on in the course that will enable them to explore the rest of the course topics through computational thinking practices.

#### <ins>Instructional Methods</ins>

CodeHS has many built in and recognized features for its programming environment. These features can be used to push self-starters, advanced, or students looking for a challenge to greater levels of complexity. However, these same features can be used to scaffold instruction to support both learners with special needs or English Language Learners.

<ul>
<ins>For Advanced learners</ins>: Each lesson showcases a list of  commands that can be used to accomplish a given task. However, to promote an individual's expression and choice to move beyond the prescribed commands, there is a list of all commands. Students can explore this list and use them to accomplish a given task using more complex commands.

<ins>For Learners with Special Needs</ins>: Briefly I'd like to define 'Learners with Special Needs' as Students with Disabilties or any student in need of additional differentiation or scaffolding. Each lesson provides definitions of keywords, written notes, verbal descriptions, example problems, tutorial videos, and slides to present information which is available to students at all times. In addition, each lesson provides a visual for the goal of activity available in the programming environment. In tandem with these resources, CodeHS has a “block” coding feature that an instructor may choose to enable to let students “drag blocks around” to create their program.

Furthermore, these features should be able to cover any IEP or 504 plan accommodation or modification.

<ins>For English Language Learners</ins>: 
The above description <ins>For Learners with Special Needs</ins> details accommodations that may be made for English Language Learners.
</ul>

### Prerequisites

<ul>

#### Who is this course for?

The Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course doesn't require any prior computer science knowledge in order to be successful. Simply an interest in computer science and willingness to work hard/adhere to the rigor of an AP course.

#### Content Knowledge

There are no official prerequisites (C or better is IM1/Algebra 1 recommended) and the course is meant to be a first-time introduction to computer science, but students should be comfortable with basic linear functions and function notation, composition of functions, and problem-solving strategies that require multiple approaches and collaborative efforts. In addition, students should be able to use a Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system to represent points on a plane. It is important that students and their advisers understand that any significant computer science course builds upon a foundation of mathematical reasoning that should be acquired before attempting such a course. Prior computer science experience is not required to take this course. (Special cases may be considered)

#### Resource Requirements

Students should have access to a computer system(s) that contains appropriate software to create and edit programs and allows students to practice, complete, and submit the AP Computer Science Principles performance task. The computer must have Internet access and be able to access the sites necessary for students to be successful in the course and assessment. The school ensures that each student has access to the AP Computer Science Principles Exam Reference Sheet (see Appendix), as well as performance task directions and scoring guidelines. The school ensures that each student has a college-level text or curricular resources deemed necessary by the teacher for individual use inside and outside of
the classroom.

There is also an online textbook available for many modules and topics which can be accessed through the lesson plans.

## Context

<ul>

### Course

Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)

### Situation

Currently, Pleasant Valley High School (PVHS) does not offer a computer science course of any kind. As described above in the Description I wanted to design and propose a class that was rigorous, approachable and worked well with the technology our students have and are already familiar with. PVHS is a one-to-one campus where each student is assigned a Chromebook. Furthermore, PVHS already has a healthy and robust AP program with students looking for alternatives to the “traditional” AP pathway. Lastly, with the recent shift to the block schedule PVHS is in need of more academically inclined electives that meet A-G requirements

I chose to implement AP CSP to fill the current void both for its approachable content and rigor. Starting with such a low-floor, high-ceiling course allows for us (faculty at PV) to grow our computer science department by introducing even more foundational introductory courses and by implementing courses that extend beyond AP CSP.

All technical hardware requirements such as wifi network stress and Chromebook upkeep have been approved.
</ul>

## Plan

### Software Specifications

<ul>

#### Learning Management System

<ul>
  <li>Google Classroom linked to Aeries</li>
</ul>


#### Operating System

<ul>
<li>Chrome OS</li>
<li>Windows 10 Pro</li>
<li>Windows 10 Enterprise </li>
</ul>

#### Online IDE

Students will write and run programs in the browser using the CodeHS integrated development environment (IDE). Students will be able to write text-based Python programs, and students will use a graphics library to create Python graphical programs. The CodeHS IDE is completely self-contained. There will be no need to point outside of the CodeHS site for any debugging or library usage. (A major constraint when choosing an online IDE was ensuring it was complaint with CA State Privacy Laws when it comes to minors)

CodeHS is offered as an entirely free platform for all to use. However, there is a paid version (annual licensing model). The paid version includes many desireable features a teacher would and should use for efficiency and student monitoring. 
</ul>

### Hardware Specifications

<ul>

#### Instructor Hardwarware:

<ul>

<ins>Smartboard</ins>:

ViewSonic VPC15-WP

2.8GHz, 6-core, Intel Core i5-8400 CPU

8 GB RAM

256 GB SSD Storage



<ins>Laptop</ins>:

HP Elitebook x360

1.9GHz, 4-core, Intel Core i7-8665U CPU

16 GB RAM

512 GB SSD Storage</ul>
</ul>

<ul>

#### Student Hardware:

<ul>

<ins>Laptop</ins>:

HP Chromebook 11 G5 EE Notebook 

1.6GHz, 2-core, Intel Celeron N3060 CPU

</ul>

Pleasant Valley High School (PVHS) is a one-to-one technology high school. Each student has a Chromebook. Since all work for this class will be completed and submitted using an Online IDE no other hardware will be required.

**Considerations**: Since this course is directly dependent on an internet connection it should be noted that many of the lessons, activities, assignments, and projects can be handled in an “unplugged” fashion. For example peer-to-peer pseudocoding (or similar coding preparation) may be used in the unfortunate circumstance that the wifi is down. 

</ul>

### Application

AP CSP curriculum (lessons and materials used throughout this curriculum) from CodeHS allows for educators to implement both [Project-Based Learning](https://www.pblworks.org/) (PBL) and [Culturally Responsive Education](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/collections/1041/) (CRE) pedagogical techniques in order to better engage students in the learning process. By encouraging students to use critical thinking skills and challenging them to solve authentic and meaningful problems, PBL helps students to develop a deeper and more profound understanding of the power of computation in our everyday lives. In teaching this curriculum, educators are encouraged to utilize the range of PBL and CRE techniques that have been incorporated into each unit, including driving questions, overarching unit projects, clear rubrics, regular benchmarks, scaffolding activities, final products, and reflection. Used together in a coherent, unified manner that actively engages students in the educational process, PBL and CRE strategies can help students improve their retention of learned experiences and develop stronger problem solving, critical thinking, and group communication skills. Through this collaborative, learner-centric approach, students are encouraged to explore the advantages and societal impact of computational technology while developing their own programming and computational thinking skills.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

As an instructor, I cannot ensure that *all* students will learn. Learning is a personal, self-motivated endovour. I can simply provide the optimal environment to maximize a students ***opportunity*** to learn. Through the use of various differentiation and scaffolding techniques as described in [Instructional Methods](#instructional-methods) above and throgh the 'Google Docs-like' real-time editting feature students are more connected than ever before. Using the CodeHS platforms grants me access to a number of remdiation and extenstion assignments that I would be able to use to support my students' learning. Also, since PVHS is a one-to-one school, students are not limited to working in the school computer lab (which do not currently have), but students are able to work anywhere, at any time, and collaborate with anyone on their coding assignments and projects. Additionally, because CodeHS is browser based students' questions are not limited to the classroom, but rather only limited by an internet connections and the time/willingness to continue working on coding projects outside of the school environment. All of the features described above, have poised PVHS well to make any transition back to virtual education since, again, the only limitation is an internet connection.

Now with any conncted course at any level come the challenges of plagiarism, cyberbullying, etc. First and foremost, I try to have the best faith in my students that they will not knowingly plagarise otehrs work or bully their peers. CodeHS does have a "CodeHS Honor Code" document that instructors are encouraed to use and have students sign dicussing what is acceptable and what is not. This honor code document is meant to set the tone for class culture and good digital citizenship to help prevent students from bullying/cheating. However in the case that simply honor does not encourage a high school student from cheating, CodeHS does have various other features that may be utilized to prevent plagarism. For instance, there is a code history, timestamp, and time tracker to see what, when, and how long a student added code, as well as, a copy and paste prevention. Beyond these feautures educators will just have to use their own sense about what they think a student is capable of in an introductory class.

As our Computer Science program continues to grow and evolve, CodeHS with its plethora of courses affords PVHS a unique opportunity to implement many different goal-oriented computer science pathways.
